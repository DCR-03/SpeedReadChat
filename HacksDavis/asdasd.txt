Third, through exploration and colonization, Europeans came into contact with
the people and customs of other continents. From the perspective of European
observers, non-Western peoples were “living fossils” whose lifeways
provided analogies for interpreting the function and meaning of European
antiquities. Despite the fallacy inherent in viewing other cultures as “primitive”
and “static,” such comparative studies led to some important insights, including
recognition of stone tools as the products of humans.
A fundamental limitation of early antiquarianism was that no methods,
independent of speculative notions of technological and moral progress,
existed for ordering things in time. The emergence of archaeology as a historical
and scientific discipline was aided by developments in geology and biology during
the 18th and 19th centuries. The principles of stratigraphy provided
archaeologists with a systematic method for ordering cultural remains in time.
The recognition of fossils of extinct plants and animals suggested that the
world was much older than traditionally thought. This recognition created a
tension between Biblical accounts of human origins and history and a growing
body of archaeological and paleontological evidence. This tension was resolved
for many scholars in 1859 with acknowledgment of the great antiquity of the
human species, supported by Darwin’s theory of organic evolution by natural
selection. Finally, the development of systematic excavation and record
keeping techniques in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by archaeological
field workers, such as Pitt-Rivers in England, Flinders Petrie in Egypt, and Nelson
and Kidder in North America, established the standards of professional
archaeological practice still in use today.
